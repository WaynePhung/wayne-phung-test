/*
    This mixin is used to position and wrap children elements relative to the parent container element. It takes the following arguments to define flexbox properties for container elements:
        1. Sets the display to flex (essential for any of the other flex properties to function as intended).
        2. Enables/disables the wrapping of the children elements based on the "$flexWrap" variable argument.
            - "wrap" to have the children elements populate within the space 
              of the container
            - "nowrap" to have the children elements instead populate within 
              the same row/column
        3. Sets the orientation of the wrapping, whether in a row or column. This is based on the "$flexDirection" variable argument.
        4. Sets the starting position of each children element relative to the container element. This is based on the "$alignItems" variable argument:
            - "flex-start" to start from the beginning portion of the container
            - "center" to start from the middle portion
            - "flex-end" to start from the bottom portion
            - "stretch" to take up the available space of the container
        - Sets the positioning of all children elements relative to the container element. This is based on the "$alignContent" variable argument:
            - "flex-start" to orient all the children elements from the 
              beginning portion of the container
            - "center" to orient all the children elements from the middle portion
            - "flex-end" to orient all the children elements from the bottom portion
            - "stretch" to take up the available space of the container
        - Sets the alignment of all children elements when they don't take up all of the available space in the container. This is based on the "$justifyContent" variable argument.
