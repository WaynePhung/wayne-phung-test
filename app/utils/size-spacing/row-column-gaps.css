    Key naming scheme is analogous to T-Shirt sizing:
        2xs = xxs = extra extra small
        xs = extra small
        s = small
        sm = small medium
        m = medium
        ml = medium large
        l = large
        xl = extra large
        2xl = extra extra large
        [n]xl = [number of xs] extra large
*/
/* Inset applies to the padding of an element. */
/* Stack applies to bottom vertical space (mainly between elements or establishing negative space). */
/* Inline applies to right horizontal space (mainly between elements or establishing negative space). */
/* Default inset spacing for different types of buttons.*/

    UPDATE COMMENT
    Mixin to define the space between each children element in a 
    container with flex display. For grid display, this defines the 
    space between each grid cell. Varaible arguments are defined below.
        - "$rowGap" is the horizontal spacing between elements in a 
          flexbox container or grid cells.
        - "$columnGap" is the horizontal spacing between elements in a 
          flexbox container or grid cells.
        - By default, each argument has a default value of zero (no space), 
          even if the argument is empty. However, the value of either or both 
          arguments can be non-zero if specified.
