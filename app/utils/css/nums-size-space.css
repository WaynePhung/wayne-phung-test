    Key naming scheme is analogous to T-Shirt sizing:
        2xs = xxs = extra extra small
        xs = extra small
        s = small
        sm = small medium
        m = medium
        ml = medium large
        l = large
        xl = extra large
        2xl = extra extra large
        [n]xl = [number of xs] extra large
