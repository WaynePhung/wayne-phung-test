    UPDATE COMMENT

    This Sass variable creates a map key value pairs, where each pair consists of the following:
    - the expression on the left represents a key
    - the expression on the right is value associated with that key

    In this case, the values on the right represent the corresponding values for hue, saturation, and lightness 
    of the color names on the left, which are the exact colors intended for usage in the visual 
    appearance of text, buttons, and other visual elements.
    For example "darkBlue" is a key that is a color name, and "hsl(" is a hexcode value that is 
    associated with "darkBlue".

    The map below is used for a simple, but reproducible function called "color($colorName)" that 
    can be used to clearly communicate which color is being to for one or more selected elements.

    This map can be expanded to include more colors other than the ones already listed, and the 
    hexcode values can be conveniently changed so that all elements that uses the same color will 
    have their colors updated to reflect this change.

    For more information on maps and key-value pairs, copy and paste this URL on an article about 
    maps from the Sass official website: https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/maps/
*/
/*
    UPDATE COMMENT
    This function uses the map from the "$colors" variable to return the desired color included from 
    the map.

    The mapping of color names is necessary to avoid confusion from using color hexcodes on which 
    colors each element is using and to make the code usage of the CSS color property reproducible, 
    more understandable, and with less repetitive code.

    This mixin is used to position and wrap children elements relative to the parent container element. It takes the following arguments to define flexbox properties for container elements:
        1. Sets the display to flex (essential for any of the other flex properties to function as intended).
        2. Enables/disables the wrapping of the children elements based on the "$flexWrap" variable argument.
            - "wrap" to have the children elements populate within the space 
              of the container
            - "nowrap" to have the children elements instead populate within 
              the same row/column
        3. Sets the orientation of the wrapping, whether in a row or column. This is based on the "$flexDirection" variable argument.
        4. Sets the starting position of each children element relative to the container element. This is based on the "$alignItems" variable argument:
            - "flex-start" to start from the beginning portion of the container
            - "center" to start from the middle portion
            - "flex-end" to start from the bottom portion
            - "stretch" to take up the available space of the container
        - Sets the positioning of all children elements relative to the container element. This is based on the "$alignContent" variable argument:
            - "flex-start" to orient all the children elements from the 
              beginning portion of the container
            - "center" to orient all the children elements from the middle portion
            - "flex-end" to orient all the children elements from the bottom portion
            - "stretch" to take up the available space of the container
        - Sets the alignment of all children elements when they don't take up all of the available space in the container. This is based on the "$justifyContent" variable argument.

    These three mixins makes a container of code reusable for specifying the minimum 
    and/or maximum width condition(s) to apply the CSS properties and values.
        - "mediaQuery-minOnly" sets up a media query for only the minimum width used in the media query's condition.
          - "mediaQuery-maxOnly" sets up a media query for only the maximum width used in the media query's condition.
          - "mediaQuery-minMax" sets up a media query for a range between the minimum and maximum widths used in the media query's condition.

    These mixins uses two or three of the following:
        - "$min" is a variable used as this mixin's argument to specify the number value for the minimum width used in the media query's condition.
        - "$max" is a variable used as this mixin's argument to specify the number value for the maximum width used in the media query's condition.
        - "@content" is a Sass directive that allows flexibile input of different CSS properties and values, whether to apply the same properties for multiple elements or tailor different properties to specific elements.

    This mixin uses two different variables to toggle the display of an element.

    If value of the "$state" variable is "show", the element would appear 
    with either of these display properties.
        - If the element is a ToC container, the default display would be in flex to 
          display the children elements as a horizontal row.
        - Otherwise, set the display of that element to what it originally had, as 
          defined within this CSS file.

    If the value of the "$state" variable is "hide", that element would not appear 
    at all. The space that it took up would also not appear.

    This mixin doesn't do anything if the value of the "$state" variable is neither 
    "show" or "hide".

    UPDATE COMMENT
    Mixin to define the space between each children element in a 
    container with flex display. For grid display, this defines the 
    space between each grid cell. Varaible arguments are defined below.
        - "$rowGap" is the horizontal spacing between elements in a 
          flexbox container or grid cells.
        - "$columnGap" is the horizontal spacing between elements in a 
          flexbox container or grid cells.
        - By default, each argument has a default value of zero (no space), 
          even if the argument is empty. However, the value of either or both 
          arguments can be non-zero if specified.

    The name "%link" defines a placeholder selector.
    Placeholder selectors have the percent (%) character before the selector name, and they have a use case of templatizing repetitive lines of code that need to define reusable CSS properties and values for multiple elements.

    The reusable aspect of placeholder selectors is that the CSS properties and values defined won't be constantly reproduced in the outputed CSS file, reducing repetitive code and the 
    size of the CSS file. Instead, they are used in "@extend" directives where elements that mention these directives would inherit the CSS elements, properties, and values defined in the corresponding placeholder selector.

    For example, the "%hover" placeholder selector below mentions elements that are also not the ficaption element to have the mouse cursor set to the pointer appearance and to have the text of children paragraph (p) elements to be underlined. 
    An element that has the class name ".class" may use the extend directive to inherit the elements, cursor property, and the text-decoration property from "%hover".

    .class {
        @extend hover;
    }

    Resulting CSS output would be...

    .class {
        &:not(figcaption) {
            cursor: pointer;
        }
        p {
            text-decoration: underline;
        }
    }
