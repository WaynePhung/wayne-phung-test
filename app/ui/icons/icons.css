    This mixin is used to position and wrap children elements relative to the parent container element. It takes the following arguments to define flexbox properties for container elements:
        1. Sets the display to flex (essential for any of the other flex properties to function as intended).
        2. Enables/disables the wrapping of the children elements based on the "$flexWrap" variable argument.
            - "wrap" to have the children elements populate within the space 
              of the container
            - "nowrap" to have the children elements instead populate within 
              the same row/column
        3. Sets the orientation of the wrapping, whether in a row or column. This is based on the "$flexDirection" variable argument.
        4. Sets the starting position of each children element relative to the container element. This is based on the "$alignItems" variable argument:
            - "flex-start" to start from the beginning portion of the container
            - "center" to start from the middle portion
            - "flex-end" to start from the bottom portion
            - "stretch" to take up the available space of the container
        - Sets the positioning of all children elements relative to the container element. This is based on the "$alignContent" variable argument:
            - "flex-start" to orient all the children elements from the 
              beginning portion of the container
            - "center" to orient all the children elements from the middle portion
            - "flex-end" to orient all the children elements from the bottom portion
            - "stretch" to take up the available space of the container
        - Sets the alignment of all children elements when they don't take up all of the available space in the container. This is based on the "$justifyContent" variable argument.

    These three mixins makes a container of code reusable for specifying the minimum 
    and/or maximum width condition(s) to apply the CSS properties and values.
        - "mediaQuery-minOnly" sets up a media query for only the minimum width used in the media query's condition.
          - "mediaQuery-maxOnly" sets up a media query for only the maximum width used in the media query's condition.
          - "mediaQuery-minMax" sets up a media query for a range between the minimum and maximum widths used in the media query's condition.

    These mixins uses two or three of the following:
        - "$min" is a variable used as this mixin's argument to specify the number value for the minimum width used in the media query's condition.
        - "$max" is a variable used as this mixin's argument to specify the number value for the maximum width used in the media query's condition.
        - "@content" is a Sass directive that allows flexibile input of different CSS properties and values, whether to apply the same properties for multiple elements or tailor different properties to specific elements.

/* Inset applies to the padding of an element. */
/* Stack applies to bottom vertical space (mainly between elements or establishing negative space). */
/* Inline applies to right horizontal space (mainly between elements or establishing negative space). */
/* Default inset spacing for different types of buttons.*/
